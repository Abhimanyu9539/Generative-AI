# Generative AI Projects

Welcome to my **Generative AI** repository! Here, I’m exploring and implementing various **Generative AI** concepts and applications as I dive deeper into this transformative field.

## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains projects that demonstrate:
- **LangChain** implementations for chaining generative tasks
- **Prompt Engineering** techniques to improve model output
- Applications of **Generative AI Models** in image, text, and audio generation

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation

## 🌱 Learning Journey
I am actively learning about **Generative AI** and exploring the ways it can be applied to real-world tasks.
